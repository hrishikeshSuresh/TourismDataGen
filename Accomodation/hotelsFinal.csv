21096,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",5, the room was well appointed - even had night clothes you could buy in the closet. I left behind a nice leather coat w/ sentimental value. called a few days later. they had found it and shipped it via Fed Ex. I asked to pay for the shipping and they insisted on covering the cost. A nice touch in my opinion. I have no reservations referring this hotel.,great hotel

It also has indoor and outdoor swimming pool. The only downside is that the lobby is very small and there was customer dog barking annoyingly and loudly - I wish they have an isolated area for customers with dogs.,Family stay
